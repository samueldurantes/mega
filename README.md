Hello! This project was created as a personal endeavor since I was curious about the previous year's cutoff scores. [SISU](https://acessounico.mec.gov.br/) only provides an [XLSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel#File_formats) file with a lot of unnecessary information, so I decided to create this project to make life easier for anyone who shares this curiosity.

## Getting started

1. Install packages

```bash
$ yarn install
```

2. Run in the development environment

```bash
$ yarn dev
```
